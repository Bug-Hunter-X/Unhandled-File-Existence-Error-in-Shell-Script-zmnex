This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting: the failure to handle cases where a file may not exist. The `bug.sh` script attempts to process a file without checking if it exists, leading to an error if the file is missing.  The `bugSolution.sh` provides a corrected version which includes robust error handling.  This example highlights the importance of defensive programming in shell scripts to prevent unexpected failures and improve the overall robustness of your scripts.
